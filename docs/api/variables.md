# Variables #

The following variables can be used on pages:

- `page`: The page name
- `config`: Contents of the `settings.ini` file in this repository (a
  [configparser object](http://docs.python.org/2/library/configparser.html))
- `locale`: Locale code of the page language
- `available_locales`: Locale codes of all languages available for this page
- `site_url`: URL at which the website is served. The value is taken from
  `settings.ini` (`general/siteurl`) during static generation and is equal to
  the test server URL (normally `http://localhost:5000`) when working with the
  test server.
