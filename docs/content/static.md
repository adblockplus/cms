# Static files #

Any files located in the `static` directory will be available on the server
unchanged. The file `static/css/foo.css` will be available under the URL
`/css/foo.css`.

Language-specific static files should be stored in the `locales` directory.
Read more about localization in the guide, [Localization files](locales.md).
