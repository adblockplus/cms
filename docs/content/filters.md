# Custom filters #

The `filters` directory can define custom Jinja2 filters which will be available
in all Jinja2 templates. The file name defines the filter name, e.g.
`filters/myfilter.py` will define a filter named `myfilter`. This file should
also contain a function called `myfilter`, this one will be called when the
filter is invoked. For more information on Jinja2 filters see
[official documentation](http://jinja.pocoo.org/docs/dev/api/#writing-filters).
